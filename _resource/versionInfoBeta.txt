6.4.0.1 -- Jan / 28 / 2015

... Major update ...
bug potential > moderate/high

>
Switched to using /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy to 
read (and partly write) plists instead of 
defaults (~10x faster).Based on this 
improvement I've stopped loading entirely 
from saved state on start. This means 
changes you make to the dock in-between 
opening cDock will once again show.
Generally this is just a huge boost for the 
app because itdoes a lot of plist reading 
and writing.

>
Added several docks created by Deviant art users

>
Magnification popup now has disabled option
Removed magnification checkbox

>
Recents folder option is now a checkbox
cDock can now remove recents folder

>
Add <type> spacers changed to <type> spacers
cDock can now remove spacers
Removing spacers starts with the leftmost spacer

> 
'Reset cDock' option added to settings. This is
the same as what 'Restore Dock' used to do just
deletes ~/Library/Application Support/cDock/*
and some other cDock related things like the 
cDock/coloredfindersidebar bundles

>
App should open faster

>
Settings should apply faster

>
Main window will retain state after viewing settings

>
Main window title will include "Beta" if using a beta version

>
Settings window should draw/close faster

>
Cut out accidental unnecessary downloads of version.txt 
if the app had already checked for updates that day

>
Added small ping check so we don't bother trying to
update if there's no connection to the internet 
and/or sourceforge

>
Removed save state junk I was using to load the
app faster

>
Added Email button as an alternate to the bug report button

>
Fixed some minor bugs

>
Tooltips added to settings window

>
UI adjustments

> 
cDock now makes backups of com.apple.dock.plist
Backups are made before applying changes
Backups are saved @
~/Library/Application Support/cDock/.bak/*
Currently no limit to number of backups

> 
'Restore Dock' in settings added pop-up
allowing user to select from com.apple.dock.plist
backups

NOTES:

This may end up as version 7.0. The change
PlistBuddy is HUGE and allows for much more 
controlover the dock plist. The number of
improvements and or changes in this version 
seems large enough to merit the major 
version bump.
