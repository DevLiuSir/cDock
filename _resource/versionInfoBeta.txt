Version		: 6.4.0.2
Build date	: January / 31 / 2015

------------------------------------------------
This is a beta build. Please let me know if issues arise.
------------------------------------------------

6.4.0.2

-- Email button automatically attaches logs to email.

-- Updated credits and welcome window.

------------------------------------------------

6.4.0.1

:: New :: 

-- Switched to using /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy to read (and partly write) plists instead of defaults (~10x faster). Based on this improvement I've stopped loading entirely from saved state on start. This means changes you make to the dock in-between opening cDock will once again show. Generally this is just a huge boost for the app because itdoes a lot of plist reading and writing.
 
-- Added dock themes created by Deviant Art users:
xxfunsizexx
davidmonteiro
nittiyh

-- Magnification popup now has disabled option.

-- Removed magnification enabled checkbox. It is now controlled through popup.

-- Recents folder option is now a checkbox.

-- cDock can now remove recents folder.

-- Add app/doc spacers popup changed to app/dock spacers.

-- cDock can now remove spacers. Removing spacers starts with the leftmost spacer.

-- 'Reset cDock' option added to settings. This is the same as what 'Restore Dock' used to do. Applying this deletes ~/Library/Application Support/cDock/* and some other cDock related things like the cDock/coloredfindersidebar bundles.

-- Main window will retain state after viewing settings window.

-- Main window title will include "Beta" if using a beta version.

-- Email button as an alternate to the bug report button.

-- Tooltips added to settings window.

-- cDock now makes backups of com.apple.dock.plist
	Backups are made before applying changes
	Backups are saved @ ~/Library/Application Support/cDock/.bak/*
	Currently no limit to number of backups
	
-- 'Restore Dock' in settings added. Popup allows users to select from com.apple.dock.plist backups.
 

:: Performance improvements and fixes ::

-- cDock should open faster.

-- Settings should apply faster.

-- Settings window should draw/close faster.

-- Cut out accidental unnecessary downloads of version.txt if the app had already checked for updates that day.

-- Added small ping check. This prevents trying to update if there's no connection to the internet and/or sourceforge.

-- Removed save state junk I was using to load the app faster.

-- General bug fixes.

-- UI adjustments.
