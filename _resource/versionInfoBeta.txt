6.4.0.1 -- Jan / 28 / 2015

... Major update ...
bug potential : moderate/high

> 1 <
Switched to using /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy to 
read (and partly write) plists instead of 
defaults (~10x faster).Based on this 
improvement I've stopped loading entirely 
from saved state on start. This means 
changes you make to the dock in-between 
opening cDock will once again show.
Generally this is just a huge boost for the 
app because itdoes a lot of plist reading 
and writing.

> 2 <
Added several dock themes created by Deviant art users

> 3 <
Magnification popup now has disabled option
Removed magnification checkbox

> 4 <
Recents folder option is now a checkbox
cDock can now remove recents folder

> 5 <
Add <type> spacers changed to <type> spacers
cDock can now remove spacers
Removing spacers starts with the leftmost spacer

> 6 <
'Reset cDock' option added to settings. This is
the same as what 'Restore Dock' used to do just
deletes ~/Library/Application Support/cDock/*
and some other cDock related things like the 
cDock/coloredfindersidebar bundles

> 7 <
App should open faster

> 8 <
Settings should apply faster

> 9 <
Main window will retain state after viewing settings

> 10 <
Main window title will include "Beta" if using a beta version

> 11 <
Settings window should draw/close faster

> 12 <
Cut out accidental unnecessary downloads of version.txt 
if the app had already checked for updates that day

> 13 <
Added small ping check so we don't bother trying to
update if there's no connection to the internet 
and/or sourceforge

> 14 <
Removed save state junk I was using to load the
app faster

> 15 <
Added Email button as an alternate to the bug report button

> 16 <
Fixed some minor bugs

> 17 <
Tooltips added to settings window

> 18 <
UI adjustments

> 19 <
cDock now makes backups of com.apple.dock.plist
Backups are made before applying changes
Backups are saved @
~/Library/Application Support/cDock/.bak/*
Currently no limit to number of backups

> 21 <
'Restore Dock' in settings added pop-up
allowing user to select from com.apple.dock.plist
backups

------------------------------------------------

Not yet implemented <idea in place>:

> <
hide/Show application title tooltips checkbox
-- might be tricky --

INFORMATION / ASSISTANCE WANTED:

> Some classy dock themes

change the dock based on the time of day?
