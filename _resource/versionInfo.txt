Notes
  -- This update has limited testing, it may break some functionality.
  -- If you follow the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy
  -- and are running an out of date version of OSX this might not be for you.
  * If you don't know your password... you should.
  * Google search how to change it or create a new admin account.
  ** I don't have either of these versions of OSX installed to test on...
